            <p>
              Originally from Jackson Missisippi, I am a proud alumni of Lanier High School and Jackson State University. 
              I spent most of my time growing up with a Trombone in my hand as I found music my go to at a very young age. 
              I moved to Garland Texas in August of 1999 and married my childhood sweetheart whom blessed me two sons. Once in Texas
              of course I became consumed in football and ultimately began coaching sports. Initially it was a way to bond with my son.
              Later on it became a way of me to bond with other young men and be a positive roll model in their lives. My technology career began as an Accessory Salesman at Fry's Electronics where I learned everything I needed to know about
              home based hardware. I instantly knew Tech was for me. After diving in and out of hardware, I became interested in the software
              side of things. Especially with the emergence of Social media sites such as Black Planet that would allow the user control to 
              customize their pages, my interest peaked more and more as time went by. I am looking forward to my journey into the software
              side of technology. My goal is to one day deliver a seamless end user experience.
